                <br>

                <p>In Python, variables are used to store data, and there are several data types to represent different kinds of information. Here are some common data types and examples of how to use them:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Integer (int)</h3>
        <p>
            Integers represent whole numbers, both positive and negative.
            This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fractions or decimals). In Python, there is no limit to how long an integer value can be.

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
            <h3>Float (float)</h3>
            <p>
                Floats are used to represent decimal numbers.This value is represented by the float class. It is a real number with a floating-point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, the character e or E followed by a positive or negative integer may be appended to specify scientific notation.

            </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>
            String (str)
        </h3>
            <p>
                Strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote, or triple-quote. In python there is no character data type, a character is a string of length one. It is represented by str class. 

            </p>
        
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>
            Boolean (bool)
        </h3>
            <p>
                Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False. Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false). But non-Boolean objects can be evaluated in a Boolean context as well and determined to be true or false. It is denoted by the class bool. 

Note – True and False with capital ‘T’ and ‘F’ are valid booleans otherwise python will throw an error. 
            </p>
        
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>
            List
        </h3>
        <p>
            Lists are just like arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.  

Creating List 

Lists in Python can be created by just placing the sequence inside the square brackets[]. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>
            Tuple
        </h3>
        <p>
            a tuple is also an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between a tuple and a list is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created. It is represented by a tuple class.  

Creating a Tuple
In Python, tuples are created by placing a sequence of values separated by a ‘comma’ with or without the use of parentheses for grouping the data sequence. Tuples can contain any number of elements and of any datatype (like strings, integers, lists, etc.). Note: Tuples can also be created with a single element, but it is a bit tricky. Having one element in the parentheses is not sufficient, there must be a trailing ‘comma’ to make it a tuple.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>
            Dictionary
        </h3>
        <p>
            A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, a Dictionary holds a key: value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key-value pair in a Dictionary is separated by a colon : , whereas each key is separated by a ‘comma’.

Create a Dictionary
In Python, a Dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’. Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable. The dictionary can also be created by the built-in function dict(). An empty dictionary can be created by just placing it in curly braces{}. Note – Dictionary keys are case sensitive, the same name but different cases of Key will be treated distinctly. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>
            Set
        </h3>
        <p>
            In Python, a Set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.

Create a Set in Python
Sets can be created by using the built-in set() function with an iterable object or a sequence by placing the sequence inside curly braces, separated by a ‘comma’. The type of elements in a set need not be the same, various mixed-up data type values can also be passed to the set. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>
            NoneType (None)
        </h3>
        <p>
            The None type represents the absence of a value.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
